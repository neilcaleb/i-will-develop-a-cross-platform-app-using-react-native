## How it works

Here are the steps to complete your Basic package project:

### 1. Requirements
We make sure you have communicated your overall app idea to me and I understand what the app is going to be doing

### 2. Prototyping (UI & UX)
We design your app in Figma. Feedback will be required constantly as we design the app, so we are both on the same page and going in the correct direction

**This step includes:**
- Your feedback

### 3. Development of screens
I'll develop a real app that has screens only without functionality yet

**This step includes:**
- Your feedback

### 4. Development of backend
We will develop the server and database needed for your app

### 5. Making the app fully functional
In this step, we will make your app fully functional

**This step includes:**
- Your feedback

### 6. Submission to the stores
We will upload your app to the stores and make it live for the general public
